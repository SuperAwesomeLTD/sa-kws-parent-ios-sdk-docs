Add the SDK as a static library
===============================

You can download the latest `KidsWebServicesParentSDK-1.2.0.iOS.lib.zip <https://github.com/SuperAwesomeLTD/sa-sdk-build-repo/blob/master/package/kws_parent_ios/1.2.0/KidsWebServicesParentSDK-1.2.0.iOS.lib.zip?raw=true>`_
file - which contains the **libKidsWebServicesParentSDK.a** and associated **include** folder to add to your project as a static library.

Once you've downloaded the zip archive, open it and add the library and the folder in your project.
